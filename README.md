# Movie-Recommender-System
In this project, we utilize model-based collaborative filtering and MovieLens dataset to build a prototype movie recommender system. You, as a new user, can select one favorite movie from the drop-down menu and then 10 movies will be recommended to you base on previous users' experience. Such interactive user interface is implemented on Jupyter notebook.
